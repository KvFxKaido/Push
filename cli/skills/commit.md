# Stage and commit changes with a clear message

Review the workspace and create a commit.

1. Run git_status to see what changed.
2. Run git_diff to review the actual changes.
3. Write a concise commit message (WHY, not WHAT). Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, etc.) if the project uses them.
4. Run git_commit to stage and commit.

{{args}}

If there are no changes, say so and stop. Do not ask for confirmation.
