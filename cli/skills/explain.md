# Explain how code works

1. If a file path was given, read it. If a concept/function name was given, use search_files to locate it, then read.
2. If nothing specific was given, read the project structure with list_dir and project instructions for a high-level overview.
3. Explain: what the code does and why, data/control flow, dependencies, non-obvious design decisions.
