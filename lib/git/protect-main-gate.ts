/**
 * lib/git/protect-main-gate.ts — builds a `PrePushGate` that enforces Protect
 * Main at the push boundary itself, independent of the `PreToolUse` Protect Main
 * hook (`default-pre-hooks.ts`).
 *
 * This is defense-in-depth, not a replacement: the pre-hook gates the *tool
 * call*; this gate guards the *actual push*. The push handler reads the real
 * HEAD branch right before `git push` — when the sandbox must be up anyway — so
 * even if the pre-hook is ever bypassed (not wired, a desynced live read, a new
 * push path), a push to the protected branch still cannot leave the boundary.
 *
 * Failure posture is the INVERSE of the secret-scan gate (see
 * `secret-scan-gate.ts`): this is a **safety** gate, so it fails **closed**. A
 * match blocks, and so does any inability to prove the branch is safe
 * (unreadable / detached / empty HEAD). The secret scan fails open because a
 * diff-read hiccup must not brick every push; here, "can't verify the target
 * branch" is exactly the state a protection gate must refuse — blocking a legit
 * push is a recoverable retry, leaking a commit onto main is not.
 *
 * Symmetric structured logs, one per branch (see CLAUDE.md):
 * `protect_main_push_clean` ↔ `protect_main_push_blocked` (with a `reason`
 * sub-tag) ↔ `protect_main_push_skipped`.

 *   - `branch`       — a single concrete destination branch to check.
 *   - `unverifiable` — the gate cannot prove a single safe destination, so it
 *                      must fail closed. Covers Git's matching refspec (`:` /
 *                      `+:`, which pushes every same-named branch incl. main),
 *                      option-shaped refs (`--all` / `--mirror` / `-f`, passed
 *                      verbatim to `git push`), and empty/garbage refs.

 * destination behind a commit-search rev; `--all`/`--mirror` push everything).
 * So this is a strict ALLOWLIST: only forms that trivially resolve to the
 * checked-out branch or one plain destination branch are evaluated; ANYTHING
 * carrying a colon, a force-with-no-branch, option flags, or rev/glob syntax is
 * `unverifiable` and the gate fails closed. Push's own push path passes no
 * `ref` (so it's `current`); explicit refspecs are not a supported flow, so
 * rejecting them costs nothing and removes the whole parser-emulation risk.
