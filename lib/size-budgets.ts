/**
 * Canonical character budgets for content folded into agent prompts.
 *
 * One inventory so per-role caps stop being duplicated magic numbers scattered
 * across agent modules — the 12k project-instructions cap was previously defined
 * identically in two agents, and tool-result caps lived in three places. Note
 * that centralizing the *declaration* does not collapse the *values*: each
 * consumer's budget is intentionally distinct (a Coder carries more context than
 * a read-only investigator; a side hint gets less room than primary guidance),
 * and the rationale lives here next to the number rather than in scattered
 * inline comments.
 *
 * Scope: per-block content *truncation* caps, plus the diff-chunking limits
 * (`DIFF_LIMIT` feeding `chunkDiffByFile` in the reviewer / deep-reviewer /
 * auditor — see `reviewerDiffChunk` / `auditorDiffChunk` below). Intentionally
 * excluded: aggregate budgets like coder's `MAX_TOTAL_CONTEXT_SIZE` (a
 * whole-message size limit / context meter, not a single-block cap).
 *
 * Two distinct diff families live here, don't conflate them: `auditorDiff` is
 * the auditor's single-block diff *display* truncation; the `*DiffChunk`
 * entries are the per-file chunking caps fed to `chunkDiffByFile`.
 *
 * Lib-owned. The web `app/src/lib/agent-loop-utils.ts` copy imports the
 * read-only tool-result cap from here transitively. The CLI's project-
 * instruction cap routes through the shared `formatProjectInstructionsBlock`
 * (the 8K `projectInstructionsDefault` below), and its workspace free-text
 * memory cap is now `workspaceMemory` here too. The CLI's entry-COUNT caps
 * (`MAX_TREE_ENTRIES`, `MAX_STRUCTURED_ENTRIES` in `cli/workspace-context.ts`)
 * stay local on purpose — they bound a *number of items*, not characters, so
 * they're out of this char-budget module's scope.
 *
 * Pure module — no imports, no I/O. Safe for both Web and CLI.

   * Was 4_000, on the rationale that the Coder already carries the most other
   * context and can read the full file from the sandbox on demand. The fallback is
   * real — a truncated block appends "Full file available at /workspace/AGENTS.md"
   * — but it is opt-in, and a model does not reliably go fetch the rulebook it was
   * not handed. At 4k this repo's own AGENTS.md lost its entire second half:
   * Validation commands, "Behavior lives in code", decision-doc discipline, and the
   * new-feature checklist — i.e. every convention that constrains how code gets
   * written here, withheld from the role writing it. Meanwhile the read-only
   * Explorer, which cannot change a line, got 12k.
   *
   * This deliberately cuts against the "trim, don't raise" rule in
   * lib/agents-budget.test.ts. That rule guards `projectInstructionsDefault`, which
   * bills EVERY turn on EVERY surface; this one bills once per delegated Coder run.
   * Different blast radius, different call. Files past 8k still truncate and still
   * get the sandbox pointer.
